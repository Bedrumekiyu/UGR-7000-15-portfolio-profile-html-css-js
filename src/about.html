    <h2>My Work Experience</h2>
    <p>During my time as a software engineering intern at XYZ Tech Solutions, I had the opportunity to work on various projects that enhanced my technical skills and provided valuable industry experience. I collaborated with a team of developers to design and implement a web application that streamlined the client onboarding process, resulting in a 30% reduction in processing time. My responsibilities included writing clean, efficient code in JavaScript and Python, conducting code reviews, and participating in Agile ceremonies such as daily stand-ups and sprint planning. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with version control systems like Git and learned to effectively communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. This internship not only honed my programming abilities but also taught me the importance of teamwork and adaptability in a fast-paced environment.</p>
